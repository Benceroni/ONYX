By the way... I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn! There's no time for tears I'm just sitting here planning my revenge There's nothing stopping me From going out with all of your best friends And if you come around saying sorry to me My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn! And if you're missing me You'd better keep it to yourself 'Cause coming back around here Would be bad for your health... 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time In case you haven't heard I really really hate that... Stupid old pickup truck You never let me drive You're a redneck heartbreak Who's really bad at lying So watch me strike a match On all my wasted time As far as I'm concerned You're just another picture to burn! Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn You're just another picture to burn Baby, burn..."

Don't know why I do Drew walks by me Can he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly The kind of flawless I wish I could be She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do So, I drive home alone As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down And maybe get some sleep tonight 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see"

'Cause it seems to me This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak I don't feel welcome anymore Baby, what happened? Please tell me 'Cause one second it was perfect Now you're halfway out the door And I stare at the phone He still hasn't called And then you feel so low You can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to When he said forever and always Oh, and it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always Was I out of line? Did I say something way too honest? Made you run and hide like a scared little boy I looked into your eyes Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure So here's to everything coming down to nothing Here's to silence that cuts me to the core Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore And I stare at the phone He still hasn't called And then you feel so low You can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to When he said forever and always And it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always You didn't mean it baby I don't think so, oh oh oh Back up, baby back up Did you forget everything? Back up, baby back up Did you forget everything? Back up, baby back up Please back up, oh back up Back up, baby back up 'Cause it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always And I stare at the phone He still hasn't called And then you feel so low You can't feel nothing at all And you flashback to When we said forever and always 'Cause it rains in your bedroom Everything is wrong It rains when you're here And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always You didn't mean it baby You said forever and always, yeah"
